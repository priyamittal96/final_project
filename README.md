# final_project

Using both an app flask and OpenCV I wanted to explore some of the image and video processing packages available. There are quite a few applications with processing media, whether it be through object tracking, filters, object detection, etc. through various models and processing methods.

# Python Scripts

There are 2 image_view.py files. The one outside in the main folder has been used to process the .mov file and create some of the images that are within the image processing folder. Each labeled according to the processing method applied on the .mov file. 

The one within the Final Website folder is used in conjunction with the app flask to perform a transformation to an upload. 

# Presentation
The presentation highlights the key details of the project and what parts of OpenCV were used and the results. 

# Website
The website allows the user to upload a photo and generate a page that shows the black&white version. It is currently a demo and is hardcoded to only populate one given image.
